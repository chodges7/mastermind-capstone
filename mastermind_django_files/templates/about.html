    <br><h3>Project Description</h3><br>
    <p>
        This project is a version of the popular code-breaking game Mastermind from the 1970s.
        Mastermind is a logic puzzle game that tests the player's ability to find the correct permutation of the specified
        objects. The objects that I want to use in my online game are letters and words. A similar application to my project is
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though, I wanted to improve on Wordle. In Wordle, a player can only play once a day and the correct word is
        always the same no matter who is playing on that specific day. This is both a
        pro and a con for Wordle since it allows players to brag about getting the same word before another person, but it means
        that it limits the amount of playtime to around 10 minutes per day. I wanted to solve this problem by allowing my game to
        run as a time trial version of Wordle. This would keep the advantage of allowing players to brag about their top score
        since they would be able to share how many words they could guess in a set amount of time, and it would eliminate the
        con of limiting gameplay because players would play until they wanted to stop. The word that the player is guessing
        would not be limited to once a day.
    </p>

    <p>
        One last thing to mention is that there is a service called
        <a href="https://www.wordleunlimited.com/">Wordle Unlimited</a>
        which creates Wordle after Wordle without having to wait another day, but I
        think this is actually a con for the service because it doesn't provide another way of encouraging players to share
        their scores or provide more challenge. The reason many people come back to Wordle day after day is that they can share
        about it since it is the same word for everyone.
